# ERSRedux
A beginner's implementation of a card game.

How does a young programmer with no knowledge of GUI design and two weeks worth of Java experience program a card game? Well, now you know.

ERSRedux is a historical repository for its developer, not a functional project, so there are no promises of useability. That being said, feel free to crawl through the source and check out... whatever you were looking for.

Enjoy!
